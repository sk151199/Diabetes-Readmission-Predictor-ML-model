Diabetes Readmission Predictor

This project is a Machine Learning application that predicts the likelihood of hospital readmission among diabetic patients based on their past medical encounters.
It was developed as part of a 12-hour end-to-end sprint, covering everything from data cleaning and model training to deployment on Streamlit.

üìò Problem Statement

Hospital readmission is a major concern in healthcare systems, especially for chronic conditions like diabetes.
The goal of this project is to predict whether a patient will be readmitted to the hospital and, if so, within what timeframe based on their demographic and medical data.

The model classifies each patient encounter into three categories:

No Readmission

Readmission within 30 days

Readmission after 30 days

By identifying high-risk patients early, healthcare teams can design better follow-up plans and reduce avoidable readmissions.

‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

Data Understanding

Used the UCI Diabetes dataset containing 100,000+ hospital encounters (1999‚Äì2008).

Explored features such as age, admission type, diagnoses, medications, and lab results.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Removed duplicate and irrelevant features.

Handled missing and inconsistent data.

Encoded categorical variables and normalized numerical values.

Feature Engineering

Grouped patients into age brackets.

Derived new features for number of prior visits and medications changed.

Model Training

Compared multiple classifiers:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Selected the best-performing model based on accuracy and recall.

Evaluation

Used confusion matrix and classification report for evaluation.

Balanced the dataset to reduce class bias.

Deployment

Integrated the trained model into a Streamlit web application.

Built a user-friendly interface where patient attributes can be entered to get predictions instantly.
